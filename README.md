<h1>Day Verse</h1>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>
So, the verse of the day works as follows, it is a program that starts the session through Selenium by opening a 
"Google Chrome" browser and returns the verse of the day accompanied by the DATE.
Then you will have a question, and you can choose whether you want to read the verse from the previous day (Yesterday), 
and it is very easy to answer "Y" for yes, and "N" for no.
